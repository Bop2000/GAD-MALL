# Finite Element Simulation Pipeline Automation
This is the guideline to automate the pipeline of FEM (Matlab for Gyroid structures generation in STL format → Hypermesh draw the mesh in .inp format → Abaqus conduct FEM analysis and output a .odb file for further calculation of mechanical properties).

## Environements
The developmental version of the package has been tested on the following systems and softwares.
- Windows 10
- Matlab R2020a
- Hypermesh 2019
- Abaqus 2018

## RUN
To run this automated pipeline, the only thing is to use PowerShell to run `BatchProcess.ps1`
**Note:** The initial porosity matrices are archived in the `finished.mat` file. Upon executing 'BatchProcess.ps1', the process unfolds in three stages. Firstly, Matlab is invoked to execute `test1.m`, which transforms the porosity matrices into corresponding Gyroid STL files. The second stage involves deploying Hypermesh to run `command.tcl`, which converts STL files into mesh files. In the final stage, Abaqus is employed to execute `BatchProcess_v0.4.py`, which conducts the Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis and archives the output as .odb files.

## Note
If the program cannot be run, please check if the paths in the code are correct.
