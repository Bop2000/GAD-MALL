This script processes stress-strain curve data from finite element simulation
to extract key mechanical properties including Young's modulus and yield strength
using the 0.2% offset method. The analysis includes data preprocessing,
curve fitting, and visualization of results.

Requirements:
- scipy, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, prettytable
